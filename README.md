# pymaceuticals-cancer-treatment-analysis
Welcome to pymaceuticals! This project uses Pandas to organize a csv with results of cancer treatments on mice. Various outcomes are represented in graphs and boxplots in matplolib.
Summary statistics are performed on the results as a means of determining potentially successful/unsuccessful treatment regiments.
