# pymaceuticals-cancer-treatment-analysis
Welcome to pymaceuticals! This project uses Pandas to organize a csv with results of cancer treatments on mice. Various outcomes are represented in graphs and boxplots in matplolib.
Summary statistics are performed on the results as a means of determining potentially successful/unsuccessful treatment regiments.

Next we have a box plot graph of tumor volume as well as an outlier identified by a red mark

Here we check on the individual mouse's results MouseI509. We can see his tumor size progression on the cancer treatment Capomulin.

Finally we have a graph of tumor volume by mouse weight. Perhaps this cancer study needs to control by mouse size due to the high correlation between mouse size and tumor size. The results may not be telling if other factors influence tumor size.
